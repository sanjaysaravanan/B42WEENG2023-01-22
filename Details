  The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.

  if scrolling makes an element move, then it is affected by scrolling

  Position
    static/initial:
      1. Goes with the normal flow of the document
      2. Occupies its own space in the document
      3. Not affected by top, right, bottom, left values
      4. Affected by scrolling -> scroll moves the div element
    
    Relative:
      1. Goes with the normal flow of the document
      2. Occupies its own space in the document and does not allow other elements to sit in its place
      3. Affected by top, right, bottom, left values with respect to its initial postion inside parent
      4. Affected by scrolling

    Absolute:
      1. Removed from the normal flow of the document and made to appear float over normal flow of the document
      2. No Space is occupied in the page layout
      3. when **no** top, right ... props are specified itstays in original postion but float above normal flow of the document
      4. Affected by top, right, bottom, left values with respective to initial 
          containing block (html tag) ** if provided none of its parents( immediate/grand/grand-grand ) has non static position value**
        ** When some of its parents has non static position value then it moves with respective to the closest positioned parent **
      5. Affected by scrolling
    
    Fixed:
      1. Removed from the normal flow of the document and made to appear float over normal flow of the document
      2. No Space is occupied in the page layout
      3. Affected by top, right, bottom, left values with respective to initial 
          containing block (html tag)
      4. Not Affected by scrolling

    Sticky:
      1. Goes witht the normal flow of the document
      2. Occupies its own space in the document
      3. Affected by top, right, bottom, left values with respective to initial 
          containing block (html tag)
      4. affected by top, left, ... values till the top, left, ... values are reached else not affected by scroll
  
  Overflow: (overflow-x, overflow-y)
    visible: overflow will be visible and would hide the parent ( default value)
    hidden: hides the overflowing content
    auto/overlay: adds horizontal / vertical whenever the contents is overflowing
    scroll: irrespective of overflow adds a scroll bar permanently
  
  measurements / Units:
    Absolute Unit: 
    px - pixel, pt - point, pc - picas
    1px = 1/96th of an inch

    1pt = point 1/72th of an inch

    1pc = picas,  12 * 1pt or 1/6th of inch

    Relative Units:
      %, vh, vw, 
      1% -> 1 percent of the parent's property value

      vw -> viewport width
        1vw -> 1 % viewport width
      vh -> viewport height
        1vh -> 1 % viewport height

  emphemeral units (font-size) default font-size ----> 16px
    em, rem ---> root em
      1rem = fontsize of the root element ( Initial Containing Block )
      1em = fontsize of the parent element

      2rem = 2 * fontsize of the root element ( Initial Containing Block )
      2em = 2 * fontsize of the parent element

  Flex-Box:
    display: flex;
      it takes over the control of the children (width & height)

    direction -> row: children placed in single row
      justify-content moves content horizontally
        start
        center
        end
        space-evenly
        space-around
        space-between
      
      align-items moves content vertically
        start
        center
        end

      flex-wrap:
        wrap -> wrappes the children horizontally when a width reduces less than child width
        nowrap -> shrinks the width of the children to accommodate inside parent
    
    direction -> column: children placed in single column
      justify-content moves content vertically
        start
        center
        end
        space-evenly
        space-around
        space-between
      
      align-items moves content horizontally
        start
        center
        end

      flex-wrap:
        wrap -> wrappes the children horizontally
        nowrap -> shrinks the height of the children to accommodate inside parent
    
    flex-flow: specify both direction and wrapping
